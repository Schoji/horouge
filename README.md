# 🕯️ Horouge — Horror + Roguelike made in 24h

**Horouge** is a 2D horror roguelike game created in just 24 hours during **HackYeah 2025**.  
The project blends **pixel art** with **PS1-style** visuals to create an eerie, nostalgic atmosphere.  
It was fully developed in **Godot 4.5**.

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

You play as a lone wanderer lost in a haunted forest.  
Armed with nothing but a flickering flashlight, you explore the darkness —  
but beware: the light reveals what hides in the shadows.

### Features:
- 🔦 **Dynamic flashlight system** — lights up the area in the direction the player is facing.  
- 🚶‍♂️ **4-directional movement (WASD)** — complete with walk animations.  
- ⚔️ **Directional attacks** — the player can attack in four directions, each with unique animations.  
- ❤️ **Health system** — represented by 5 hearts displayed at the top of the screen.  
- 🕷️ **Enemy: The Spider** — a simple AI enemy with walk animations and hit/hurtbox logic.  
- 🌲 **Environment objects** — leafless trees, bushes, stones, and pathways that create a grim, desolate mood.

## ⚙️ Technology Stack

- 🎮 **Engine:** Godot 4.5  
- 🎨 **Visuals:** Pixel art + low-poly models made in Blender

## 🧩 Planned Features (not implemented due to time limit ⏳)

Even though we only had 24 hours, the original idea was much bigger:

- 🌍 **Procedurally generated environments** — random placement of trees, bushes, and rocks, inspired by *The Binding of Isaac*.  
- 🕳️ **Multi-floor system** — each level would generate a new map layout.  
- 👹 **Floor bosses** — unique encounters after clearing each floor.  
- 👁️ **Light-sensitive enemy** — a creature that could only be defeated by turning the flashlight off.
